This is how I coded this project.
First, I follow a tutorial online and build the whole project.
Second, I break down the project step by step and make a checklist for the whole project. 
After that, I rebuild the whole project by myself with a little help from the tutorial for the steps I can't do by myself. 
I repeat this process for all the projects.
